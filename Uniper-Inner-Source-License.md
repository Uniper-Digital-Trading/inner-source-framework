This Uniper Inner Source License ("Uniper-ISL") applies to Works (as defined below) made available under Uniper ISL Terms. The Work may be used only as permitted by this license (to the extent such use is reserved by the copyright owner).

The Work is made available under the terms of this license if the Licensor (as that term is defined below) places the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for that Work:

* "Original Work": the work or software distributed or made available by Licensor under this License, as source code and executable code, if any.
* "Adaptations": the works or software that Licensee may create based on the Original Work or its Adaptations. This license does not specify how extensive the modification must be or how much reliance must be placed on the Original Work for it to be classified as an Adaptation; this is determined by the applicable copyright law
* "Work": the original work or its adaptations.

## 2. Scope of the license rights

The Licensor hereby grants to you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license, which entitles you, for the Uniper Group's business purposes:

* to use the Work without restriction,
* to reproduce the Work,
* modify the Work and create derivative works based on the Work,
* to distribute the Work or reproductions of the Work within Uniper,

For the exercise of these rights, any currently known or future media, carriers and formats may be used, provided that applicable law does not prevent this.

Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use its patents to the extent necessary to exercise the rights to use the Work granted by the license.

## 3. Accessibility of the source code.

The Licensor may make the Work available either as source code or as executable code. If it makes it available as executable code, it shall also make available a machine-readable copy of the source code for each copy of the work that it distributes, or it shall refer in a notice following the copyright notice accompanying the work to a location where the source code can be easily accessed free of charge for as long as the licensor distributes or makes the work available.

## 4. Limitations on ownership rights

It is not the purpose of this license to limit exceptions or limitations to the Author's exclusive rights in the Work that benefit Licensee. This license also does not affect the exhaustion of such rights.

## 5. Obligations of the Licensee

The granting of the above rights is subject to several restrictions and obligations for the Licensee:

* Inner Source: Licensee may use the Work solely for the Uniper Group's business purposes.
* Copyright notice, license text, attribution of Contributor: Licensee must leave unchanged all copyright, patent or trademark notices and all references to the license and disclaimer. Licensee must include these notices and this license with each copy of the Work that it distributes or makes available. Licensee must clearly indicate on each Derivative Work that the Work has been modified and indicate the date of modification.
* "Copyleft" Clause: Licensee may distribute or make available copies of the Original Work or Derivative Works only under the terms of this Uniper ISL or a later version of this license within Uniper. Licensee (who becomes the Licensor) may not offer or impose additional terms on the Work or Adaptation that modify or limit the terms of this license.
* Provision of Source Code: If Licensee distributes or makes available copies of the Work, Licensee must include a machine-readable version of the source code or provide a location where such source code can be readily accessed without charge for as long as Licensee distributes or makes available the Work.
* Legal protection: This license does not permit the use of the Licensor's distinctive signs, trademarks or protected name rights, unless this is necessary for the reasonable and customary description of the origin of the work and the reproduction of the content of the copyright notice.

## 6. Author and Contributor

The original Licensor warrants that it owns the copyright in the original work or that it has been licensed to it and that it has the authority to grant this license.

Each Contributor warrants that it owns the copyright in any modifications it makes to the Work and that it is authorized to make and contribute under this license.

In each case where Licensee accepts the license, the original Licensor and all subsequent Contributors grant an authorization to use the Contributions to the Work under the terms of this license.

## 7. Exclusion of warranty

In the event that the company internal terms and conditions do not apply, the following provisions shall apply.

Development of this Work is ongoing; it is constantly being improved by numerous Contributors. The Work is not completed and may therefore contain errors ("bugs") inherent in this type of development.

For the reasons stated above, the Work is provided under this license "as is" without warranty of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, and non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright (see Article 6 of this License).

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the license and a condition for the granting of rights to the work.

## 8 Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability

If the company internal terms do not apply, the following provisions shall apply.

Except in cases of willful misconduct or causing personal injury, Licensor shall not be liable for any direct or indirect, tangible or intangible damages of any kind arising out of the license or use of the Work, including, but not limited to, loss of goodwill, loss of production, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or economic loss, even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor shall be liable under the statutory product liability provisions to the extent that such provisions are applicable to the Work.

## 9. Supplemental agreements

If Licensee distributes the Work, Licensee may enter into supplemental agreements specifying obligations or services consistent with this license.

Licensee may enter into obligations only on its own behalf, and not on behalf of the original licensor or any other processor, and only if it agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless all such processors in the event that any claim is made against them or liability arises as a result of the warranty obligation or assumption of liability it has entered into.

## 10. Acceptance of the License

The Licensee agrees to the terms of this license by using the Work or by giving his consent in a similar manner. Using the Work is considered as an indication of unequivocal and irrevocable acceptance of the license and the clauses and conditions contained therein.

Similarly, the exercise of any of the rights set forth in Article 2 of this License, such as the creation of derivative works or the distribution or making available of the Work or copies thereof, shall be deemed an indication of unambiguous and irrevocable consent.

## 11. Information obligations

If the licensee distributes or makes the work available (for example, by offering it for download from a website), the licensee must provide minimum information to the addressee or the public through the distribution channel or medium used, usually regarding the licensors, the license and its accessibility, the conclusion of the license agreement, and how the license can be stored and reproduced by the licensee.

## 12. Termination of the License

The License and the rights granted thereunder shall automatically terminate if the Licensee breaches the terms and conditions of the License.

Such termination of the License shall not terminate the licenses of any third parties to whom the Work has been provided by Licensee under this License, so long as such persons comply with the License Terms.

## 13. Submission of Contributions

Except as otherwise expressly stated, any Contribution knowingly submitted by Licensor for inclusion in the Work is subject to the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement that Client may have with Contractor for such Contributions.

For those countries where moral rights in a work may arise, the copyright owner/author waives its moral rights to the extent permitted by law in order to effectively license the exploitation rights set forth above.

## 14. Other

Without prejudice to Article 9, this License constitutes the entire agreement of the parties relating to the Work.

German law shall apply. If any provision of the License is void or invalid under applicable law, this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the License per se. Rather, such provisions shall be construed or modified to be valid and enforceable.

## 15. Changes under company law

In the event of changes under corporate law, e.g., the sale or spin-off of a Uniper company, the following provision shall apply:

Any further use of the Licensed Software by a company that is no longer a member of the Uniper Group shall be subject to the consent of the authors or the [decision-making body].

## 16. License modifications

The Authors/Copyright Owners of a Work may jointly decide to modify the license, e.g. to publish the Work as open source software. If the Authors are not available or cannot agree, the [decision-making body] may decide to amend the license for a Work on behalf of all Authors within Uniper.

## 17. Dispute resolution

Notwithstanding anything in the company internal Terms of Service between the parties, the following shall apply between the parties:

In the event of any dispute relating to the interpretation and application of this License involving more than one Group Company, the [Decision-Making Body] shall serve as the decision-making body, which may be invoked by either party.
